# WpfAsyncDemo

## simple sync/async demo in C#

Asynchronous programming can be intimidating. What's even worse is when 
you think you learned how to do something and then you try it in your 
application and it doesn't work. This video is an attempt to fix all of 
that. In it,  you will see how to use the async and await keywords to 
make your user interface more responsive and to speed up your code's 
operation. You will also see how to turn an existing method from 
being synchronous to asynchronous. Along the way, we will cover best 
practices and how to make sure our application behaves like we expect 
after we make a part of it asynchronous.

Now that we know how to do the basics in async, let's take it to the next 
level. In this video, we look at how to get status reports back from 
asynchronous tasks so we can display a progress bar and more to the 
screen while they are running. We also set up the ability to cancel a 
long-running or hung asynchronous task.

We will also explore the differences between adding tasks in a foreach 
loop vs Parallel.foreach and how we can even get the benefits of both 
methods at the same time.
